"SUPER SWEET APP NAME" is an app for splitting bills with your friends.

Basic stuff:
+ Let you add your friends as contacts for quick bill splitting with your most-used contacts.
+ Keep a running tally of your debts and credits with all your friends, with a history of the events that got you there.

Doable stretch:
+ Store debts and credits in different currencies and convert them on demand using open currency API. (Should this conversion be based on the date of the transaction or the date you're making the conversion. I believe the API has a history to support both.)
+ Integrate with PayPal API to send invoices with notification emails.
+ Integrate with Facebook/Google to provide quick access to friends.
